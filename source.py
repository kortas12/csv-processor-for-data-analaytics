"""
*the source of the data processor program I made all the mathematical functions at this file
*at the first we have the functions that deal with the big databases:
1 avrage
2 mediator
3 mod
4 minor value
5 great value
then we have the work functions:
1 read csv
2 write csv
3 process csv
*the basic program function that made by all the previous functions: process data
*I divided the functions of the work to give the flexibility to the program algorithm
*the program.py is the interface code takes the program algorithm from the source and let it work on interface
*you can use the source with a simple interface as an educational subject for databases processing and csv reading and writing
*all rights received to meÂ© (im just ceding I don't have any real copy rights :) )
